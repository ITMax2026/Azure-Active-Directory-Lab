Steps for setting up a VM in azure and installing Windows Server 2022

1. Create a VNET
 - VNET Name: vnet-adlab
 - Create a resource group - rg-adlab-eastus2
 - Create a VNET with address space 10.0.0.0/16
 - Create two subnets:
    Workload at 10.0.1.0/24
    AzureBastionSubnet at 10.0.2.0/26 (for an Azure Bastion the subnet CIDR must be 26 or larger)

2. Create the VM - this one will be used as the Domain Controller
  - Computer Name: DC-01
  - Image: Windos Server - 2022-datacenter-azure-edition
  - Size: Standard B2ms (2 vcpus, 8 GiB memory) - ##I chose these specs to be performant for a lab while being cost effective
  - Networking: vnet-adlab/Workload, No public IP
  - Disk: ## Again chose this setting for adequent performance while being cost effective
      - Size: 127 GiB
      - Storage type: Standard SSD LRS

  - After creation, set the VM private IP to static:  10.0.1.4 (Static)

3. Create Bastion - 
  - Can be done using the Connect menu inside the VM and filling in your username and VM password
