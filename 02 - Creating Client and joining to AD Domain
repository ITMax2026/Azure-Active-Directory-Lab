I am using a Windows Server image for the client because on Azure you need an Enterprise license to use the Windows 11 VM image.

1. Create a VM - this will be a client
  - Computer Name: Client-01
  - Image: Windows Server 2025 Datacenter: Azure Edition - Gen2 (When I ran this part of the lab when Windows Servers 2025 was the recommended Gen 2 image)
  - Size: Standard B2ms (2 vcpus, 8 GiB memory) - ##I chose these specs to be performant for a lab while being cost effective
  - Networking: (this part is important so that the new Client connects on the same network as the Domain controller and inherits the same DNS settings) 
      -Virtual network: vnet-adlab
      -Subnet: Workload 
      -No public IP
  - Disk: ## Again chose this setting for adequent performance while being cost effective
      - Size: 127 GiB
      - Storage type: Standard SSD LRS

2. Join the domain
   - System > About > Workplace or Domain Controller > Click change:
     - Computer Name: Client-01
     - Membor of (select) Domain: ad.lab
   - Have to use Domain controller username and password
   - Can check the client joined Active Director in Active Directory Users and Computers on the Domain Controller - It is not domain joined
